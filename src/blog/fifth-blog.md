## New Theme
"New card. What do you think?" Instead of a business card, this is a new theme I’m trying out for my portfolio. I was inspired by the Dracula theme from VS Code, and I wanted my portfolio to match that aesthetic as well. I’m still working on adding a toggle button to switch to light mode, but overall I think this minimal look is better than spending days trying to turn my portfolio into a full VS Code replica.

## Thinner
Three weeks into the cut, I’ve lost four pounds. My goal is to lose as much fat as possible before Beyond. The easiest part is being able to make my favorite high-calorie meals into low-calorie by replacing a few ingridents.  The hardest part of my cut has been watching people eat burgers and tacos on my feed or right next to me. I hung out with some friends at Cane’s, and all of them ordered a box combo or something bigger. Luckily, I was already deep into my cut, so it was easier to resist.
