## Japan!!

I went to Japan with my family for a week. It was a journey that started in the city of Tokyo. From the moment we arrived, the city felt incredibly alive — bright lights, towering buildings, and a constant flow of people moving with purpose. Tokyo felt almost cyberpunk in the way technology, advertisements, and city life blended together. Walking through areas like Shinjuku made me realize how futuristic yet slightly dystopian parts of the city could feel, especially around the red-light district. Despite that contrast, I was still able to take advantage of the weak yen and pick up new clothes and goods.

My last stop in Japan took me to Osaka, where the vibe felt completely different. Maybe it was because I had more free time during that part of the tour, but Osaka ended up being my favorite stop. The city felt more laid-back and friendly, while Tokyo felt fast-paced, almost like I had accidentally stepped into the life of a salaryman. The experience made me realize how each city in Japan carries its own personality, even though they exist within the same country.

After Japan, the trip continued to what I jokingly call the motherland — Hong Kong, the land of DLLM. Unlike Japan, I was able to freely explore the city without being tied to a tour schedule, which made the experience feel more personal and immersive. Our hotel was located in the center of Hong Kong, giving me a direct view of the urban skyline stretching across the bay. One of my favorite moments was visiting Victoria Peak at night, where I was able to see a clear, illuminated view of the entire skyline. Standing there and looking over the city was easily one of the most memorable parts of the trip.

Spending time in Hong Kong allowed me to reconnect with my roots. Compared to Japan, it felt like being at home, but in a way that felt even more deeply connected to Chinese culture. Being able to speak the language naturally again made everyday interactions feel comfortable and familiar. Walking into restaurants, markets, and shops and hearing conversations in Cantonese reminded me of growing up around family and community.

The food also played a big role in that feeling of connection. Eating dishes like my favorite, Hong Kong egg toast, brought back memories of meals I had growing up, but tasting it in Hong Kong felt like experiencing it in its most authentic form. Beyond language and food, the overall environment felt familiar in ways that were difficult to describe. The energy of the city, the way people interacted, and the everyday rhythm reminded me of home. The experience made me reflect on how culture shapes identity and how parts of my background remain deeply connected to places like this.
