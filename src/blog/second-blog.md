## Practicing Golf
This is my second blog and I wanted to talk about getting better at golf.
I used to just go to the range hitting the ball as hard as I could, but
after playing golf many times, you need to practice getting the right
kind of shot. Maybe I need 130 yards to the green so I'll use a p wedge
with 80% tempo.  Things like that can help you improve by a lot.

## Watched a Movie
I also watched the movie Weapons and it was not what I was expecting.
Can't really say much without spoiling it but the final act was what
made me enjoy the movie.
