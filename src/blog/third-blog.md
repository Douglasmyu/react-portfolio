## Getting Jacked
I am starting to lift more weights for more reps.  All thanks to taking more creatine.
I have been increasing my dosage from the normal 5 grams to 7 grams and not only has
it helped me in the gym, it has helped my mind.

## Football is Back
NFL season has started! Week 1 and the 49ers won against the Seattle Seahawks.  Brock Prudy
threw for 277 yards and 2 touchdowns however throwing 2 picks as well.  All this happened while 
my starter in Fantasy got my 5 points.  Thank you Joe Burrow.
